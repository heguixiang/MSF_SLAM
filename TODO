Multiple fuzzy tracking states

extern templates c++11

Eigen::Map wrap Q-blocks (if possible)

Multiplication of F blockwise

Obs-constrainted EKF prediction

symm P: EV decompose P, set EVs<eps to zero and rebuild (profile this to know the cost!)

make sensor_manager provide interface to add measurement to core, so that 
measurements dont need to include the core, but just the base manager class. 

use more polymorphism to reduce compilation time and break up dependencies

plot_scripts autogen with correct indices from msf_core

TRUE MODULARITY:
a) template sensors to calibration states
b) Every sensor has a set of states (calib bias etc) these get added to a large state vector automatically.
